\Caption{Power measured under a moving significance threshold}
{Power was calculated as the proportion of replicate association analyses ($n=100$, per combination of risk category and \gls{maf} interval) in which any signal reached significance within 1~\gls{Mb} around the position of a simulated risk variant.
A moving significance threshold between ${\pvalue\leq\num{1e-8}}$ and ${\pvalue\leq\num{1e-4}}$ was applied to each association dataset.}
