\Caption{Allele frequency spectrum in the 1000 Genomes Project}
{The allele frequency distribution is shown per chromosome (1--22) for all variants contained in the final release dataset of \gls{1kg} Phase~\rom{3}.
Singletons (private mutations observed only once in the sample) were excluded.
Note that data are shown on log-log scale.}
