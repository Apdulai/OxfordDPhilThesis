\Caption{Topology of a genealogical tree in the coalescent}
{The genealogical relationship of \n{3} haploid individuals is shown, $A$, $B$, and $C$, which represent separate lineages at present, but where $A$~and~$B$ are the first to coalesce (back in time).
The waiting time between successive coalescent events is denoted by \Correct{$T_j$}, where \Correct{$j$} is the number of ancestral lineages at a given time interval, which changes from \Correct{$j$} to \Correct{${j-1}$} at coalescence.
Figure modified from \citet{nordborg2001coalescent}.}
