\Caption{Allele frequency changes over time simulated under the Wright-Fisher model}
{A haploid population was simulated under \n{4} different constant values of population size, $N$, as indicated in each panel.
The change in allele frequency is shown by generation.
For each value of $N$, \n{5} replicate simulations were conducted (distinguished by colour).
Note that the allele frequency does not change after it has reached 0~or~1; \ie the allele is said to have become \emph{fixed} in the population.}
