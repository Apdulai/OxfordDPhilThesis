\Caption{Significant risk-associated variants listed in the NHGRI-EBI Catalogue}
{Results are shown for \n{3186}~unique variants which were reported as being significant at ${\pvalue\leq\num{5e-8}}$ and for which \gls{or} values were available in the database.
Note that different studies may report different \gls{maf} and \gls{or}.
Duplicate entries (variants reported in more than \n{1} study) were removed, after calculating the median value of \gls{maf} and \gls{or} across duplicates; frequencies were then rounded to \n{3} decimal places.
Data were taken from \url{http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/} \accessed{2017}{01}{20}.}
