\Caption{Distribution of inferred IBD lengths in 1000 Genomes data, chr. 20}
{Results are shown for the detected physical and genetic lengths of shared haplotype segments by \fk{}, using chromosome 20 in the final release dataset of \glsentrylong{1kg} Phase~\rom{3}, including ${N = \num{2504}}$ individuals.
IBD segments were detected using the \gls{fgt} (on phased haplotypes) and the \gls{dgt} (on genotype data).
Bottom and top of each bar represent the \nth{1} and \nth{3} quartile, respectively, between which the median (\nth{2} quartile) is marked (\emph{diamonds}).}
