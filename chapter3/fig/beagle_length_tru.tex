\Caption{IBD segment lengths inferred using \emph{Refined\,IBD} in Beagle~4.1}
{The distribution of median physical \emph{(A)} and median genetic \emph{(B)} segment length is shown by allele count (\fk{}~category).
IBD segments were inferred using the \texttt{Refined\,IBD} algorithm implemented in \texttt{Beagle~4.1}, using true (simulated) haplotype data \ref{app:fgt_h} and phased haplotype data \ref{app:fgt_p}.
Bottom and top of each bar indicate \nth{1} and \nth{3} quartiles, respectively, between which the median (\nth{2} quartile) is marked (\emph{diamonds}).\CorrectLabel}
