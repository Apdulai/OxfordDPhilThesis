\Caption{IBD segment lengths inferred in simulated data}
{The distribution of median physical and genetic length of detected IBD segments is shown by allele frequency of the focal variant (\fk{[2,25]}).
IBD detection was performed using the \gls{fgt} on true and phased haplotypes, as well as the \gls{dgt} on genotype data; \cref{app:fgt_h,,app:fgt_p,,app:dgt}, respectively.
The true IBD length is shown for comparison.
Bottom and top of each bar indicate \nth{1} and \nth{3} quartiles, respectively, between which the median (\nth{2} quartile) is marked (\emph{diamonds}).}
