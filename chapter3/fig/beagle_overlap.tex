\Caption{IBD segment overlap inferred using \emph{Refined\,IBD} in Beagle~4.1}
{Each of the inferred IBD segments were aligned with each of the true segments determined for a given pair to measure the proportion of total base overlap; interval comparisons with zero overlap were ignored.
The results shown were generated on a random subset of \n{10000} pairs in \cref{app:fgt_h,,app:fgt_p}.
The reported densities refer to the proportion of overlap with respect to the inferred segment (\emph{blue}) and the true segment (\emph{red}).}
