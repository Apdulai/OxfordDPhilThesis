\Caption{IBD segment overlap inferred using \emph{Refined\,IBD} in Beagle~4.1}
{For a given pair, each of the inferred IBD segments were aligned with each of the true segments to determine the proportion of total base overlap; interval comparisons with zero overlap were ignored.
The reported densities refer to the proportion of overlap with respect to the inferred segment (\emph{blue}) and the true segment (\emph{red}).
