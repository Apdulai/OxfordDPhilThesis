\Caption{Accuracy of alleles inferred through IBD-based phasing by focal allele frequency}
{IBD segments were randomly selected; \n{10000} per \fk{}~category.
Genotypes within each segment were phased and the relative proportions of correct, incorrect, and indeterminate alleles were recorded and averaged ($\pm\text{SE}$) per \fk{}~category.
This was done separately per segment (\emph{left}) and using the consensus approach (\emph{right}).
The results shown in Panel~\textbf{(a)} correspond to the ``truth'', where the true IBD segments were used to delimit the extent of the inferred shared haplotype sequence.
This is compared to Panel~\textbf{(b)}, where the \gls{dgt} was used to detect IBD breakpoints in genotype data.}
