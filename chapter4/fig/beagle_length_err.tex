\Caption{IBD length detected using \emph{Refined\,IBD} after integration of error}
{The distribution of physical (A) and genetic (B) segment length is shown by allele count (\fk{}~category).
Results were obtained using \texttt{Refined\,IBD} in \texttt{Beagle\,4.1}, on true and phased haplotype data; \ie \cpref{A4:fgt_h,,A4:fgt_p}, respectively.
Bottom and top of each bar indicate \nth{1} and \nth{3} quartiles, respectively, between which the median (\nth{2} quartile) is marked (\emph{diamonds}).}
