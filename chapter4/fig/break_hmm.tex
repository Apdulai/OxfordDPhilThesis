\Caption{Breakpoint accuracy using the HMM before and after error}
{Panel~\textbf{(A)} shows the density in terms of the physical distance between true and detected breakpoints and the position of a given focal allele.
Panel~\textbf{(B)} shows the physical length in terms of the relative distance between a focal site and the detected breakpoint.
See \cpref{fig:naive_break_err} for a detailed description.}
