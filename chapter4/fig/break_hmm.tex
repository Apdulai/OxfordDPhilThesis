\Caption{Accuracy of IBD breakpoint detection using the Hidden Markov Model on simulated data, before and after error}
{Panel~\textbf{(A)} shows the density of true and detected breakpoints; Panel~\textbf{(B)} shows the physical length in terms of the relative distance between a focal site and the detected breakpoint.
See \cpref{fig:naive_break_err} for a detailed description.}
