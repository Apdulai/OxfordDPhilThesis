\Caption{True positive rate of identified genotype pairs at focal sites}
{Pairwise shared genotypes at focal \fk{} variants with $k > 1$ were compared between datasets before and after error.
The true positive rate was determined for each $k$.
Results are shown for $k$~in~${[2,50]}$, which corresponds to an allele frequency between 0.04\% and 1\%.}
