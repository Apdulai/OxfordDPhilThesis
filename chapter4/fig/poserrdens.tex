\Caption{Positional genotype error density in sequencing and genotyping datasets}%
{The density of misclassified genotypes was calculated along the length of each chromosome, which were divided into equally sized chunks of 1~Mb size.
Error was calculated as the number of misclassified genotypes divided by the total number of genotypes per chunk; percent error shown on log scale.
Chunks with less than 100 genotypes were removed.
The ruler at the bottom edge of each panel shows physical distance per chromosome, where tick marks sit 10~Mb apart.\CorrectLabel}%
