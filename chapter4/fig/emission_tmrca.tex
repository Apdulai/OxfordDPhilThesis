\Caption{Empirical emission probabilities of genotype pairs observed at different T\textsubscript{MRCA}}
{The relative proportions of genotype pairs observed in IBD segments are distinguished by \glsentryfull{tmrca} for a given pair of haplotypes, which was derived from simulation records.
The datasets used to obtain the empirical distributions before and after error were the original, error-free and the error-treated dataset, respectively; see \cpref{sec:create_error_data}.
IBD segments were sampled at 50 time intervals equally spaced on log-scale.
Observation rates of genotype pairs were calculated per allele frequency bin, defined on equal steps of 1\%.}
