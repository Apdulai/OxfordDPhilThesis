\Caption{IBD length distribution using \emph{tidy} after inclusion of genotype error}
{The distribution of physical (A) and genetic (B) segment length is shown by allele count (\fk{}~category).
Results are shown for \n{3} approaches; (a) FGT on true haplotypes, (b) FGT on phased haplotypes, and (c) DGT on genotype data.
Corresponding true lengths are shown in for comparison.
Bottom and top of each bar indicate \nth{1} and \nth{3} quartiles, respectively, between which the median (\nth{2} quartile) is marked (\emph{diamonds}).}
