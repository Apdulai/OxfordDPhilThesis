\Caption{IBD segment overlap inferred using \emph{Refined\,IBD} after integration of error}
{The proportion of overlap was measured by aligning each inferred IBD segment to the set of unique true segments determined for a given pair.
Interval comparisons with zero overlap were ignored.
The results shown were generated on a random subset of \n{10000} pairs in \cref{app:fgt_h,,app:fgt_p}.
The reported densities refer to the proportion of overlap with respect to the inferred segment (\emph{blue}) and the true segment (\emph{red}).
Corresponding densities for the results obtained on data before the integration of error are shown for comparison (\emph{dashed} lines); see \cpref{fig:beagle_overlap}.
