\Caption{Misclassification of target sites in presence of genotype error}
{Simulated data were modified such that realistic distributions of genotype error were induced.
Panel~\textbf{{(a)}} indicates the rate at which alleles were observed at different frequencies after the inclusion of error.
The proportion of misclassification is indicated by colour intensity.
Panel~\textbf{{(b)}} distinguishes alleles that were falsely observed (false positive) as well as alleles that were missed after the inclusion of error (false negatives).}
