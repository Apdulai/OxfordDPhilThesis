\Caption{Expected proportions of genotype error for the genotype and allele-based models}
{The graphs show the expected proportions of true genotypes ($g$) that make up an observed genotype ($\tilde{g}$) given the true allele frequency; calculated at different, nominal error rates (see legend).
The error functions provided in \cpref{tab:errormodel} were used as in \cpref{eq:errfrqprob} and results were normalised to sum to 1 per observed genotype (columns).\AdditionLabel}
