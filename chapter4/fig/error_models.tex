\Caption{Expected proportions of genotype error for the genotype and allele-based models}
{The graphs show the expected proportion of true genotype $g_j$ observed genotype as ($\tilde{g}_i$) given the population allele frequency; calculated at different, nominal error rates (see legend).
The error functions provided in \cpref{tab:errormodel} were used as in \cpref{eq:errfrqprob} and results were normalised to sum to 1 per true genotype class (columns).\AdditionLabel}
