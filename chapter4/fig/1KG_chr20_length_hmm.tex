\Caption{IBD inference using the Hidden Markov Model on 1000 Genomes data, chromosome 20}
{IBD detection using the HMM-based method was performed under the empirical error model defined on genotype data from the \glsentrylong{1kg}.
The resulting length distribution is compared to previous results obtained on the same set of target sites using the \gls{fgt} and \gls{dgt}.
Bottom and top of each bar indicate \nth{1} and \nth{3} quartiles, respectively, between which the median (\nth{2} quartile) is marked (\emph{diamonds}).}
