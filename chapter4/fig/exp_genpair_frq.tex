\Caption{Expected frequency distribution of genotype pairs under non-IBD and IBD}%
{Proportions were calculated using \cref{eq:genpairnon} and \cref{eq:genpairibd} in both hidden states, \emph{non} and \emph{ibd}, respectively.
Colours distinguish the \n{6} possible genotype pairs, given by $g_{k_1,k_2}$, as indicated.}%
