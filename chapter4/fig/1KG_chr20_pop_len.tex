\Caption{Inferred shared haplotype lengths by population in 1000 Genomes, chr.~20}
{The distributions of physical (upper triangle) and genetic (lower triangle) length by frequency of the focal allele are shown for alleles shared between pairs of individuals from the same population (\emph{diagonal} panels) and any of the other populations sampled in \gls{1kg}.
The \gls{1kg} Phase~\rom{3} dataset comprises samples from \n{5} continental populations (or \emph{super-populations});
African~(AFR), Ad-Mixed American~(AMR), East~Asian~(EAS), European~(EUR), and South~Asian~(SAS).
Results are shown for shared haplotype lengths inferred using the \gls{fgt}, \gls{dgt}, and \gls{hmm}, on the same set of segments inferred at target sites found at \fk{[2,25]} (\ie allele frequency below 0.5\%).
The proportion of haplotypes shared within or between each population is given in each panel (upper right corner).}
