\Caption{Length distribution of shared haplotype segments using the Hidden Markov Model on simulated data}
{The HMM-based approach for targeted IBD detection was applied to simulated data before and after the inclusion of genotype error; \ie datasets $D$ and $D^\ast$, respectively.
Bottom and top of each bar indicate \nth{1} and \nth{3} quartiles, respectively, between which the median (\nth{2} quartile) is marked (\emph{diamonds}).}
