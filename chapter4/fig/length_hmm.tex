\Caption{IBD lengths using the HMM before and after error}
{The HMM-based approach for targeted IBD detection was applied to simulated data before and after the integration of error; \ie datasets $D$ and $D^\ast$, respectively.
Lengths were compared to the corresponding set of true breakpoint segments as determined from simulation records.
Bottom and top of each bar indicate \nth{1} and \nth{3} quartiles, respectively, between which the median (\nth{2} quartile) is marked (\emph{diamonds}).}
