\Caption{Probability distribution of transition dependent on IBD}
{The probability of transition was modelled dependent on the genetic distance between a particular site and the previous site and the expected age of the focal allele.
The frequency of the focal allele determines its expected age, which is shown for different frequency values.
An effective population size of ${\Ne = \num{10000}}$ was specified.
For example, the frequency of a \fk{2} allele in a sample of \n{5000} haplotypes is equal to 0.04\% (\emph{green} line).}
