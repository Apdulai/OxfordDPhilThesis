\Caption{Genetic length of shared haplotype segments inferred using the haplotype-based HMM}
{Inferred genetic length is shown by allele count of the focal variant in the simulated sample of ${N=\n{5000}}$ haplotypes, in direct comparison to the corresponding true segment lengths (\emph{blue}).
Pair selection was done using the relaxed nearest neighbour approach and at random.
Note that concordant pairs were selected at random throughout.
Results were obtained on data before \textbf{(a)} and after error \textbf{(b)}.}
