\Caption{Genetic length of shared haplotype segments inferred using the haplotype-based HMM}
{The distribution of genetic length is shown by allele count of the focal variant in the simulated sample of ${N=\n{5000}}$ haplotypes, in direct comparison to the corresponding true length at the same set of shared segments (\emph{blue} bars).
This is separately shown for concordant discordant pairs.
Pair selection was done using the relaxed nearest neighbour approach and at random.
Note that concordant pairs were selected at random throughout.
Results were obtained on data before \textbf{(a)} and after error \textbf{(b)}.}
