\Caption{Empirical probability to observe allelic pairs dependent on T\textsubscript{MRCA}}
{Using data before and after error (datasets $\mathcal{D}_B$ and $\mathcal{D}_B^{\ast}$), the rate at which the possible allelic pairs $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,1)$ were observed is shown by allele frequency, distinguished by the \gls{tmrca} between two haplotypes at a given site.
Empirical observation rates were measured at \n{100000} randomly selected haplotype pairs.
The resulting rates were averaged over \n{100} equally sized allele frequency bins and \n{100} time intervals of equal size on log-scale.
Panels \textbf{(a)} and \textbf{(b)} show the empirical distribution before and after error, respectively.}
