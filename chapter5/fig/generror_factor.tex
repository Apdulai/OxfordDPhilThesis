\Caption{Estimated correction factors before and after error}
{Correction factors were estimated per set of \fk{}~variants for which allele age was estimated in each analysis under a given clock model and IBD detection method.
Values below and above 1 indicate that true age was overestimated and underestimated on average, respectively.
The line shown per analysis indicates the trend of the corrected deviation ($\pm\,\text{SE}$), which was calculated through simple nonlinear regression by allele frequency.
Note that IBD detection using the \gls{fgt} was performed on true haplotype data (*) as well as phased haplotypes (**).}
