\Caption{Initial state probability of discordant pairs in the Hidden Markov Model (HMM)}%
{The proportion of discordant pairs that were correctly identified by their genotypes was empirically determined from data before and after the inclusion of realistic genotype error rates.
The mean per \fk{} was used as the initial state probability of the \gls{hmm}-based approach for IBD detection around target sites.
For comparison, the initial state probability of concordant pairs is shown (\emph{hollow} circles).}%
