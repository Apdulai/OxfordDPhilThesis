\Caption{Relative age using different IBD detection methods}
{The \n{3} IBD detection methods implemented in \texttt{rvage} were compared, \ie \gls{fgt}, \gls{dgt}, and \gls{hmm} (indicated at the \emph{right} of each row), under each clock model (indicated at the \emph{top} of each column).
The relative age, ${\hat{t}_\textit{rel}}$, was calculated as given in \cref{eq:age_relative}, such that $t_c$ and $t_d$ sit at 0~and~1, respectively (\emph{dashed} lines).
The \gls{cdf} of relative age estimates is shown for different frequency ranges; namely \fk{[2,5]}, \fk{(5,10]}, \fk{(10,15]}, and \fk{(15,20]}.}
