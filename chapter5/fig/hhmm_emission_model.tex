\Caption{Empirical emission model used in the haplotype-based HMM}
{The emission probabilities used in the haplotype-based HMM were determined empirically for each possible allelic pair, using datasets $\mathcal{D}_B$ (before error) and $\mathcal{D}_B^{\ast}$ (after error).
To distinguish \emph{ibd} from \emph{non}, a nominal cutoff was applied to the result shown in \cpref{fig:hhmm_emission_tmrca}.
For comparison, the resulting distributions for a \gls{tmrca} cutoff at \n{100} generations (\emph{red}) are compared to a cutoff at \n{1000} generations (\emph{blue}).}
