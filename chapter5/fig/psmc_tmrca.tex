\Caption{True and estimated T\textsubscript{MRCA} using PSMC}%
{The clock models developed in this chapter were compared to the PSMC-based method for inference of the \gls{tmrca}.
The posterior distribution on the coalescent time was obtained for the same sets of concordant and discordant pairs at \n{1000} randomly selected target positions in simulated data ($\mathcal{D}_A$).
Point estimated were taken at the mode of posterior distributions.
Colours indicate the density of true and estimated coalescent time; scaled as the maximised density.}%
